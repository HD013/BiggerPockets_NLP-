Welcome to this repository and dashboard about using NLP (natural language processing) to summarize Youtube comments from one of our favorite shows! The Bigger Pockets is a producer of Youtube, Podcast, and other products focusing on real estate investments and financing; it is a roadmap for financial freedom through real estate investment. This is one of our favorite shows! The YouTube channel of Bigger Pockets (https://www.youtube.com/c/biggerpockets) has been producing informational videos since 2016! As a big fan of the channel, we utilized NLP and sentiment analyses to draw insights on the audience's responses to each episode of the Bigger Pockets release.
