# BiggerPockets_NLP-
Welcome to this repository and dashboard about using NLP (natural language processing) to summarize YouTube comments from one of our favorite shows! The Bigger Pockets is a producer of Youtube, Podcast, and other products focusing on real estate investments and financing; it is a roadmap for financial freedom through real estate investment. This is one of our favorite shows! The YouTube channel of Bigger Pockets (https://www.youtube.com/c/biggerpockets) has been producing informational videos since 2016, with 1.16M subscribers and 3K videos released so far! (Great contents BTW) As a big fan of the channel, we utilized NLP and sentiment analyses to draw insights into the audience's responses to each episode of the Bigger Pockets release.

![View count per length](https://github.com/HD013/BiggerPockets_NLP-/assets/80353259/8a0954ea-8f9f-404d-ac15-8442297a9c05)
We found that a video length of 260 seconds (4 min 20 secs) has the most view count per second -- This seems to be a "sweet spot" of attracting view counts with the minimum efforts spent on making video productions, without compromising the view counts and contents :)
